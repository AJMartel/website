  %h1 Real-time Collaborative Document
  %p A proof of concept collaborative text editor for Standard Notes. Simply share the URL with anyone you want to collaborate with.

  %h2 Installation
  %p Copy the following url and paste it in the "Editor" dropdown under your note's title.
  %p
    %strong https://extensions.standardnotes.org/collab?name=Collaborative Editor

  %h2 Details
  %p The URL contains a unique, random identifier for the document, as well as an encryption key. Since the encryption key follows the # symbol, it is never sent to the server.
  %p
    Edits to the document are end-to-end encrypted, meaning what you type is encrypted locally
    before being sent to the server and other users.

  %p Other collaborators do not need Standard Notes to collaborate on the doc. Simply share the URL with anyone with a browser.

    Note that because this is an experimental extension, it does not yet have nice things, like conflict resolution.
